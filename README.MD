# Overview

This project was created in order to demonstrate the use of the application of SOLID, Clean Code and Security in PHP code. There is a starting file (`bad.php`) used to perform the refactoring and present flaws and solutions for them.

Failure notes are described in the files `PSR12 Violations.txt`, `SOLID Violations.txt`, `Security Violation.txt` and `CleanCode Violations.txt`.

You can see the coverage of tests and the quality metrics in the folder `tests/Reports`. Below are images of the last metric.
