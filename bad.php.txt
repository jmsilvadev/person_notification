/*
* If we want to follow SOLID design principles, and write secure code that complies with 
* the PSR-12 coding standard, what problems can you identify with the following code?
* (Assume each class/interface is in its own file, with namespaces, and classes are autoloaded).
* Do not worry about the business logic - this is a very contrived example for the sake of
* simplicity and should not be taken too literally. Do not worry about the lack of docblocks, 
* nor the lack of error handling as they have been omitted for brevity. No need to go into great 
* detail on the flaws, just highlight any security, PSR-12, or SOLID violations (hint: there are  
* five deliberate SOLID violations).
*
* Your response to this task should look something like this:
* 
* PSR-12 violations:
* The opening brace on the for loop should be on the same line in the foo method of the Bar class.
* The file should end with a blank line.
* Etc.
*  
* Security violations:
* There is a directory traversal vulnerability in the foobar method of the BarFoo class
* There is an XSS vulnerability in the render method of the FooView class.
* Etc.
*  
* SOLID violations:
* Method xyz of class Abc violates the Single Responsibility Principle by handling both 
* persistence and rendering.
* Etc.
